# Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD API project)

APOD is a website which displays the current Astronomy Picture of the day. User can search for the specific date with date picker as well as go to "see gallery" link to see the collection of the pictures from last 7-30 days(the number of photos is chosen randomly).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
and is created for my application to Mensa Philosophical Circle Frontend Developer Internship (2024).

## Run the App

In the project directory, you can run:

```sh
  npm install
  npm start
```

This will run the app in the development mode. Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in the browser.

## Additional Notes

This application was made under time limit and has room for improvement. I made sure to include the essential application logic that fits the requirement of the tasks.

Due to the time limit, I narrowed the scope of the SPA. Therefore, unit and integration tests are not provided and not all query params are supported for the APOD API.

I would highly appreciate an opportunity to discuss with you about the project and your review of the code so as to further improve my knowledge on writing professional software.
